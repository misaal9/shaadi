                This Puneri girl is more mature of the two. She loves her morning coffee and nothing beats a good book by the window and hot chocolate. Even though Sachin’s left, she remains a loyal Mumbai Indians fan. This super creative female loves her art just as much. From beautiful Warli paintings to hand-made Diwali lanterns, she loves ‘em all. She could even 'em Master Chefs a good run for their money.

                Rohit, or Misaal, as some of you know him, is the crazy one. When he is not stuffing himself with free food (he says he’s dieting but he’s not), he’s holed up at his crib with his gaming console or building something cool with Javascript <span class="codeComment">/* Yep! A Web Developer, he is */</span>. Brought up mostly in Aamchi Mumbai, he’s always up for a late night drive and loves the monsoon.

                What started off as a simple flirt-at-first sight, built up to years of friendship and before long, these two became the inseparables. It all started when these two landed in the same office about 6 years ago. Even though their offices/jobs changed, their love for food kept them together every time they snuck in for quick pasta and a smoothie at random MG road cafes. From sharing the same office lunch group to eventually sharing lives, these two have come a long way together. That last one a wee bit too cheesy, eh? :)
